For anyone that wanted to have that nohesi scoring system in his own server but couldn't because nohesi didn't open-source it.
I have made a script that is somewhat like it:
It has the following in the UI:
Highest Score: The Highest Score The Player Had Reached
Total Score: The Total Of The Drift And Overtake Scores
Drift Score: The Score You Got From Drifting
Overtake Score: The Score You Got From Overtaking/Cutting Between Cars
Combo: The score multiplier (increases by drifting and overtaking and decreases by not doing them for a time)

Leaderboard:
1.(The Top Player Server Wide) 
Highest: (Points) | Total: (Points) | Drift: (Points) | Overtake: (Points)
2.(The Second Player Server Wide) 
Highest: (Points) | Total: (Points) | Drift: (Points) | Overtake: (Points)
3.(The Third Player Server Wide) 
Highest: (Points) | Total: (Points) | Drift: (Points) | Overtake: (Points)
4.(The Player Before You If You Are Not From The Top 3) 
Highest: (Points) | Total: (Points) | Drift: (Points) | Overtake: (Points)
5.(You If You Are Not From The Top 3) 
Highest: (Points) | Total: (Points) | Drift: (Points) | Overtake: (Points)
6.(The Player After You If You Are Not From The Top 3) 
Highest: (Points) | Total: (Points) | Drift: (Points) | Overtake: (Points)
